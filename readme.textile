h4. Background

NSQLFormatter was created when a project needed a way to easily beautify the inputted SQL. The excellent NHibernate-project (http://nhforge.org) contained the necessary code but adding the reference to NHibernate's dlls was deemed a too heavy-weight solution. So, the source code in question was copied from the NHibernate and all the requirements for external references (IESI Collections) were removed.
